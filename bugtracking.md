| ---  | ---  | ---         |
| 5.12.18 | song_show.jsx | Javascript string interpolation in Link to= property threw `Illegal UNDEFINED` error in linter & broke webpack. Changed interpolated string to "string" + data & issue was resolved by Javascript type coercion. |
| 5.13.18 | user_header_bar.jsx | Attempting to render login modal with exact same steps as on landing_page.jsx. State updates when login button clicked, but modal is not rendered. Fixed by making class method that takes a choose argument & returns either LoginModal, SignupModal or null |
| 5.14.18 | upload.jsx | file sends to server, server responds with "no method error" no method 'match' for NilClass. I don't have the word 'match' anywhere in my ruby code. Used Rails console to verify whether saving an image file as an avatar was successful & received 'link failed with invalid cross-device link.' |
| 5.15.18 | upload.jsx | above issue was caused by missing application.yml file in production. Now resolved. |
| 5.15.18 | player_footer_bar.jsx | audio uploaded to aws s3 will not play due to Cross Origin Scripting. Images from same s3 bucket are visible. |
| 5.15.18 | player_footer_bar.jsx | above issue caused by npm package 'react-audio-player'. Was not able to determine how to correctly set the crossOrigin prop. Replaced component with HTML5 audio component. |
| 5.17.18 | ?? | an ajax call is being fired to /api/users/undefined resulting in a 404 error in the Javascript console |
| 5.17.18 | ?? | after cleaning up reducers, the above bug is now only occurring when loading the user show page. |
| 5.17.18 | player_footer_bar.jsx | when final song in queue finishes playing, it is added back to the queue and plays again, appending itself to the playedQueue many times unless it is manually paused. |
| 5.17.18 | player_footer_bar.jsx | above issue is intrinsic to my code. A refactor is required to resolve it |
| 5.17.18 | song/show.json.jbuilder | songs are entering state with doubled-up comment arrays (e.g. [5, 8, 5, 8]) |
| 5.17.18 | song/show.json.jbuilder | refreshed page and above issue did not persist (???) |
| 5.29.18 | song_show | need page to fire getComments action (does not yet exist) |
| 5.29.18 | player_footer_bar.jsx | Back method throws a CORS error. Skip method is almost identical code & does not throw error. File does not affect error. Skip can play songs that Back cannot. |
| 5.29.18 | player_footer_bar.jsx | above CORS error does not prevent playback entirely. If song is skipped or accessed through back method, then Play is clicked again after the CORS error is logged, the audio will play |
| 6.16.18 | song_show.jsx | a get request is being sent to /undefined when navigating to the song show page from the root or stream routes |
